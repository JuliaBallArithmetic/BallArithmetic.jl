We are interested in algorithms to compute rigorous enclosures
of eigenvalues.

We implement Ref. [Miyajima2012](@cite); the idea is to approach the problem 
in two steps, the interested reader may refer to the treatment in [Eigenvalues in Arb](https://fredrikj.net/blog/2018/12/eigenvalues-in-arb/) for a deeper discussion on the topic.
